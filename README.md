# Parallel-Computing
These programs were written by **Karthik Maiya** at **Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology** as a part of the **Parallel Computing** course. Small pieces of code may have been written by Dr. Shane Torbert. All programs are written in **C** utilizing **OpenMP** and **MPI**.

**Major Programs:**

1. **Raytracer** - a simple raytracer that utilizes MPI to provide parallel processing capabilities.

2. **Huffman Encryption** - a simple algorithm that can both both perform Huffman compression as well as decompress compressed files.

3. **Forest Fires** - a program that utilizes parallel processing in order to generate data that allows predicting how much a forest would burn based on the density of trees.
